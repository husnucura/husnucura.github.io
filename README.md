## 🎨 Deferred and Multi-Pass Rendering with OpenGL  
🔗 [Github Repo](https://github.com/husnucura/graphics2-hw2) 🔗 [Blog Post](https://blog.metu.edu.tr/e252135/2025/05/08/deferred-and-multi-pass-rendering/)  

- Implemented a deferred renderer with multi-pass shading, HDR environment lighting, motion blur, and tone mapping.  
- Rendered cubemap textures for a 360° environment with smooth camera rotation.  
- Visualized world positions and normals using geometry shaders and framebuffer objects (G-buffer).  
- Applied deferred lighting with multiple light sources using screen-space calculations.  
- Combined lighting with reflections from cubemaps for realistic environment effects.  
- Added motion blur based on camera movement velocity using Gaussian blur shaders.  
- Finalized rendering with Reinhard tonemapping and gamma correction for realistic brightness.  
- Controlled exposure, gamma, motion blur, VSync, and rendering modes via keyboard and mouse inputs.  
- Displayed real-time info overlays such as FPS and settings.  


## 🧩 3-Match Puzzle Game with Level Designer Tool in Unity  
🎥 [Watch Demo](https://youtu.be/qBanCcmzCSE)

- Developed a 3-match puzzle game in Unity with mechanics for matching, cascading, and tile interactions.
- Created a custom level designer tool to define grid-based level data, allowing the placement of empty cells, obstacles, and glass tiles.

## 🏹 Arrow Shooting Game in Unity  
🔗 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/husnucura/ArrowShooter) • 🎥 [Watch Demo](https://youtu.be/cy5SdwtsQPk)

- Developed an infinite arrow shooting game in Unity where enemies spawn from both sides.
- Implemented an aiming and shooting system with a visual trajectory preview.
- Designed enemy spawning logic to create continuous gameplay with a fixed level structure.
- Ensured intuitive controls for adjusting shot direction and force.

## 🧊 3D Tetris Game with OpenGL  
🔗 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/husnucura/graphics-hw3) • 🎥 [Watch Demo](https://youtu.be/6C-MjebKEoQ)

- Developed a fully playable 3D Tetris game as a Computer Graphics assignment using OpenGL and C++.
- Implemented various piece shapes with correct rotations and movement.
- Added mechanics for slowing down, speeding up, and instantly placing falling pieces.

## 👻 Ghost Object with Bezier Surfaces with OpenGL
🔗 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/husnucura/graphics2hw1) 🔗 [Blog Post](https://medium.com/@pingggfloyd/computer-graphics-rendering-ghost-object-with-surfaces-cc3e6518e923)

- Created a closed ghost mesh using multiple Bezier surface patches.
- Implemented smooth transitions and continuity between patches.
- Ghost follows a Bezier curve path with orientation updated by curve tangents

## 💥 Blast Cubes - Level-Based Puzzle Game in Unity

🔗 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/husnucura/blast) • 🎥 [Watch Demo](https://youtu.be/OPk0Uk6_XyQ)

- Created a level-based mobile puzzle game in Unity where players clear grids by blasting colored cubes and using rockets.
- Implemented grid-based gameplay with move limits, dynamic cube blasting, and falling mechanics fully coded without physics.
- Developed a rocket system that triggers chain reactions and combos for strategic blasting.
- Implemented different obstacle types with unique damage and fall behaviors.
